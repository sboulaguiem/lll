# LLL, Learning programming Languages for Leisure

This repo contains notes taken during our journeys learning programming for fun. Notes here is used as a broad term: anything from tips, code examples, actual notes about technical specifities of the language, or even a complete course, everything goes!

Each language will have its dedicated folder. The main source for learning is [exercism](exercism.org). The site has learning tracks for a bunch of languages consisting of a mix of written courses and exercices.
